// for practical reason i will make user can buy from home only from a restaurant cause is simpler to handle right now, in future i will think to update management to allow user order from multiple restaurants, but anyway even i did not used so much platform for ordering online i remember that for most i used does not allow to order 2 dishes from different places but make u make different orders for management reasons about timing and money split

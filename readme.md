## Description

Welcome to FOOD_APP project ‚úåüèº

As for any project that i done before, also here i wanted to understand new concepts and improve my knowledge about the already known

-**Animations**:
This is my first attempt at implementing animations and i had to manage their runtime to be synchronized with DOM functionality, some had worked better than others, for example with the spinner of page i have to figure it out how to make it follow a better flow without it to seem static first second in page, so for the moment i installed react-spinner to swamp them temporarily.

-**Typescript**:
Is the second time i use it, i'm still learning so some types could not be correct, or you may seen ofter i use `any` where i should be more specific, and this happened cause i still not fully understand how to create dynamic types that fits perfectly with components props without it tsc complaining, or other cases where i use a library where the types are more complex and requires interfaces

- **Auth0 & Custom Authentication**:
  Initially, I started using `Auth0` for authentication. However, after hitting a daily limit because i had to test PKCE code flow very often to understand better how it works when used with backend involvement instead of following frontend centric flow, I decided to build my own auth backend, though I found really interesting the functionality and logic of `Auth0` that inspire me an interest for encryption method so i try to understand some encryption algorithms, both symmetric and asymmetric.

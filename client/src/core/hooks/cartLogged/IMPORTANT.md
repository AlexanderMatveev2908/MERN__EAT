I CREATED THIS FOLDER CAUSE I WORK BETTER WHEN I DIVIDE HTML FROM JS AND IS EASIER IN MY OPINION UNDERSTAND FLOW IF WE DIVIDE CODE BY HIS LOGIC LIKE USING INPUT OR INTERVAL TO UPDATE QTY OR JUST A SIMPLE CLICK, THEY ARE NOT HOOK REUSABLE THEY ARE JUST FILE IN WHICH I WRITE CODE THAT COULD BE SIMPLY PUT IN COMPONENT FILE BUT IT WOULD MAKE FILE LONGER ADDING LINES OF CODE AND IT FEEL MORE READABLE TO ME KEEP FUNCTIONAL PART DIVIDED BY STATIC ONE, THANKS FOR READING ‚úåüèº
